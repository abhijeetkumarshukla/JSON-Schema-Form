# JSON-Schema-Form


**Dynamic JSON Schema Multi-Step Form Wizard**

  This project is a flexible, fully dynamic form generator built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS. It uses an extended JSON schema to render multi-step (wizard-style) forms with support for:

✅ Text, select, radio, and checkbox fields

🔁 Repeatable field groups (like work experience, education, etc.)

🎯 Validation and required fields

💾 LocalStorage for saving form progress

🎬 Smooth animated transitions between steps

🧠 Zero manual hardcoding — just update the schema and go!

The form adapts to any JSON structure with nested repeatables, making it perfect for building profile forms, surveys, onboarding flows, and more.
